@inproceedings{nbody,
abstract = {We present very fast algorithms for a large class of statistical
problems, which we call all-point-pairs problems, or 'N-body'-like problems.
These are problems which abstractly require a comparison of each of the N points
in a dataset with each other point and would naively be solved using N\^{}2
computations. Such algorithms cannot be applied to practical problems where N is
large. In this paper we focus on several examples of all-point-pairs problems
within nonparametric statistical learning: nearest-neighbor classification,
kernel density estimation, outlier detection, the two-point correlation,
multiple two-point correlation, and the n-point correlation. We give an
asymptotic analysis and we show empirically that this algorithmic framework
leads to several orders of magnitude in speedup over the naive computation, even
for small datasets. We are aware of no exact algorithms for these problems which
are faster either empirically or theoretically. The methodology presented in
this paper is also applicable in principle to fast, large-scale parametric
statistics such as RBF neural networks, mixtures of Gaussians, and Gaussian
processes.},
